Delphi "WebView2" Component to View Google Map with Routing and Markers Support

### Actual official version 1.3.1 (VCL)

This component is based on [TEdgeBrowser Component](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Sydney/en/Using_TEdgeBrowser_Component_and_Changes_to_the_TWebBrowser_Component) (available from Delphi 10.4)

It's very easy to use Google Maps API directly from Delphi Code, settings Component properties or invoking methods, for example:

```pascal
//Goto Address Example
EdgeGoogleMapViewer.GotoAddress(MemoAddress.Lines.Text);

//Goto Latitude/Longitude Example
var
  Location: TLatLng;
begin
  Location.Latitude := TEdgeGoogleMapViewer.TextToCoord(Latitude.Text);
  Location.Longitude := TEdgeGoogleMapViewer.TextToCoord(Longitude.Text);
  EdgeGoogleMapViewer.GotoLocation(Location);
  
//Setting Map View Mode
  EdgeGoogleMapViewer.MapTypeId := TGoogleMapTypeId(MapTypeIdComboBox.ItemIndex);
  
```
## A complete demo is available!

Notice that in the same folder of the executable you must place the correct webview2loader.dll (32 or 64 bit) as you can see into Demo\GoogleMaps\Bin\Win32 and Demo\GoogleMaps\Bin\Win64.

### Available from Delphi 10.4.2 to Latest (32bit and 64bit platforms)
